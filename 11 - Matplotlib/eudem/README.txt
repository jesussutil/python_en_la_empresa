The EU-DEM v1.1 is a resulting dataset of the EU-DEM v1.0 upgrade which enhances the correction of geo-positioning issues, reducing the number of artefacts, improving the vertical accuracy of EU-DEM using ICESat as reference and ensuring consistency with EU-Hydro public beta.

EU-DEM v1.1 is available in GeoTIFF 32 bits format. It is a contiguous dataset divided into 100x100 km tiles, resulting in a total of 1992 tiles of 4000x4000 pixel at 25m resolution with vertical accuracy: +/- 7 meters RMSE.
